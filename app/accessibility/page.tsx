              Dr. Jan Duffy and The Townes at Union Village are dedicated to providing an inclusive and accessible experience for all users, including those with disabilities. We believe that everyone should have equal access to information about real estate opportunities and services, regardless of their abilities or the technologies they use to access our website.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Our website is designed and developed to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards, where possible. These guidelines help make web content more accessible to people with disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. We continuously work to improve our website's accessibility and user experience for all visitors.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Ongoing Accessibility Efforts</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Accessibility is an ongoing process, and we regularly review and update our website to improve accessibility features. We conduct periodic accessibility audits, user testing with individuals who have disabilities, and implement feedback from our users to enhance the overall accessibility of our digital presence. Our goal is to maintain and improve accessibility standards as technology and best practices evolve.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Inclusive Real Estate Services</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              In addition to digital accessibility, we are committed to providing inclusive real estate services that accommodate the diverse needs of all clients. This includes offering various communication methods, flexible meeting arrangements, and assistance with accessibility-related housing needs. We work with clients to ensure their real estate experience is comfortable, accessible, and meets their individual requirements.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">Accessibility Features and Implementations</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Our website incorporates various accessibility features to ensure a better user experience for individuals with different abilities and assistive technologies.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Visual Accessibility</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              We have implemented features to support users with visual impairments, including high contrast color schemes, scalable text that can be enlarged without losing functionality, and clear visual hierarchy with proper heading structure. Our images include alternative text descriptions, and we ensure that important information is not conveyed through color alone. The website is designed to work with screen readers and other assistive technologies commonly used by individuals with visual disabilities.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Keyboard Navigation</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Our website is fully navigable using only a keyboard, without requiring mouse interaction. Users can tab through interactive elements in a logical order, access all functionality through keyboard shortcuts, and use standard keyboard navigation patterns. Focus indicators are clearly visible to help users understand their current location on the page. This ensures that individuals who cannot use a mouse or have motor disabilities can fully access our website content and services.

              Our website is designed to be compatible with various assistive technologies, including screen readers, voice recognition software, alternative input devices, and browser accessibility features. We use semantic HTML markup, proper form labels, and descriptive link text to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies. Regular testing with different assistive technologies helps us maintain and improve this compatibility over time.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6 mt-12">Alternative Access Methods</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Phone and Email Support</h3>

              Upon request, we can provide information in alternative formats, including large print documents, plain text versions of web content, or other formats that better meet individual accessibility needs. We work with clients to determine the most appropriate format for their specific requirements and provide materials in a timely manner to ensure equal access to information about properties and services.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">In-Person Consultations</h3>
